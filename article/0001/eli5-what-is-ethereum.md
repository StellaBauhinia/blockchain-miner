# ELI5: What is Ethereum?

I have trouble answering this question in layman's terms to people at work and even my family. I'm not the best teacher in the world, so I'm hoping you guys can help me lay it out in a way that even my daughter would understand.

Bonus question: ELI5 Investing in Ethereum (owning ETH) is investing what exactly?

A world-wide computer that is formed by lots of computers talking to each other.

(Bonus: just like Bitcoin is a world-wide Excel spreadsheet that is formed by lots of computers talking to each other)

Advantage: no one can turn it off, no one can tamper with it, and it runs exactly as programmed - because no one can, at the same time, break into the houses of all of the thousands of people running the lots of computers talking to each other - and turn those off or change something about the way they run).

(Bonus: unless... you can convince all of the thousands of people running those computers talking to each other... to change exactly the same thing at the same time about how those computers talk to each other. That is called a hard fork, but you have to come up with really good arguments to convince those thousands of people!)

Disadvantage: it's actually a really slow computer because... all of those thousands of computers that form the world-wide computer need to talk to each other first. That's a lot of talking. And it's expensive. Because the people who own these thousands of computers, all want a bit back for their electricity and the fact they bought a computer just to talk to other computers.

(Bonus: In order to pay them, we have Ether. If you have a lot of Ether, you can do a lot with this world-wide computer. Or you can just keep and sell it to someone who wants to do something with this world-wide computer.)

I'll take a stab.

Ethereum is a world wide supercomputer.

Investing in ethereum is buying rights to computation time on that super computer in the hopes it will appreciate.

You can change super computer to the next version of the web if you like.

Obviously tried to keep it short and simple.

> I'll add, from an investing standpoint:
> Bitcoin is like digital gold, it is valuable because people agree to exchange it for other things of value.
> Ethereum is like digital oil, it is valuable for the work it is able to do.

> If this iteration of the world-wide supercomputer succeeds, having some rights to the commodity that it runs on may prove to be a good investment.

well, Ethereum has the power of a 90s cell phone currently. Not really a super computer, yet. With sharding in the future it will really speed up. Golem may bring a supercomputing level processing layer on top of Ethereum sooner. But it's not Ethereum itself that does the computation, just the minimum coordination.

> It has the speed of a 90s cell phone, yes. The processing power however is that of a modern supercomputer. The problem is all that power goes toward mining instead of problem solving computing. Proof of stake is the biggest hope to stop wasting all those CPUs on mining and put them to use for on demand computation.

Oh my God, those answers could be better! OP, Ethereum is just a decentralized computer, and nothing else. Think about Digital Ocean, Linode, Amazon. Those companies allow you to borrow computers, so that you can upload programs on them, and run services, right? Ethereum is exactly the same thing. There is one key difference, though: there isn't a single party behind it. Once you upload a program on Ethereum, it can't be turned off - not by you, not by a hacker, not by a government. And that is it, really. Is that not clear enough? There is no mystery, nothing else, that's all.
