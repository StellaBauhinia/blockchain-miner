# Security Token 生态 — 项目指南

代币的新纪元正在到来。如果 2017 是 Utility Token 的一年，那么 2018 年无疑将是觊觎这 Security Token 后万亿市场的平台、交易所和基金的生态元年。受区块链技术利好和虚拟货币价格大起大落带来的套利机会吸引，资产的通证化（虚拟货币化）在更传统的发行商和投资人中变得特别流行。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*5XBQ-ZqyEMBsE77yhi9Irw.jpeg)

_各行业力量的结合创造了金融创新的新领域。_

### **什么是 Security Tokens？**

Security tokens（证劵化通证），tokenized securities（通证化证券）或者是 investment tokens（投资型通证），都是符合 SEC 规管的金融证券。这些二代通证可以为投资者提供一系列的财务权利，如股权、股息、利润分享权、投票权、回购权等。这些通证通常表示对诸如房产中的一个池塘、现金流或基金持有等基础资产的权利。这些权利被写入一个智能合约中，而这些通证在一个区块链货币交易所交易。

> 一些（通证）布道者称这些证券很快会广受欢迎，占据传统的证券和交易所和场外交易市场份额，它们在未来十年将会被完全取代。

有关更多 Security tokens 的类型以及他们与 Utility tokens 的区别，请参阅早期的一篇文章 [这里](https://medium.com/thisisdna/a-world-where-all-tokens-are-securities-227651c4e173).

### 为什么通证化？

通证化的优势包括给大型资产提供资产可分割性、给资产增加流动性、降低发行费用和加强市场效率。然而，_Security tokens 给发行者提供的最大好处是他们可以以此接触到全球的资产池_。由于这些通证可以在遵守规章的情况下在国际上销售和交易，它们的价格变得更加合理，因此，它们对投资者也更有吸引力。这个符合 SEC 要求的发行方案吸引了机构投资者，因为它的结构更加清晰；也因为技术创新，吸引了加密货币投资者。

> **新术语需知：** _“STO” —— 一个 Security token 发行方案。类似于 Utility token 发行方案的术语 ICO。_

### **如何通证化？**

如果你想把你的下一轮融资通证化，请准备好六个月的时间用以聘请顾问、律师，以及参与以下一些平台的工作。顺利完成上一步后，你的公司应该花两个月时间与顾问和法律顾问一起设计发行方案和制作营销材料；花一个月的时间与一个技术平台合作推出你的通证；最后花三个月的时间对传统和加密货币投资者们进行路演。

下面的列表应该会成为你找到合适的合作平台和投资者的坚实起点，同样它也提供了其它发行方案的蓝图。 咱们可以轻松一点了，因为我们即将进入细节部分。

Tokenized objects become “assets” that can be easily managed, governed and traded on the Swarm network. Swarm Invest, launched in January 2018, allows tokenized assets to be offered as investment opportunities. Individuals can invest cryptocurrency such as SWM, BTC, and ETH (and soon, fiat) into real world assets and receive SRC20 tokens in return, granting them ownership and governance rights, a legally enforceable right to any revenue the asset generates, and the ability to trade the tokens in a regulatory compliant manner. Areas of focus include real estate, renewables, agriculture, tech companies, crypto hedge funds, impact investments (development projects and post-disaster rebuilding), infrastructure, among others.

### Liquidity Layers:

### [Bancor](https://www.bancor.network/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*dlhGmiZgVPDvquLCMklN3w.png)

Bancor offers a liquidity model that connects multiple tokens to one pool of capital, enabling price discovery and ensuring liquidity even in low transaction volume environments. In the context of securities, this model complements existing best practices and provides alternative ways to achieve liquidity, enhancing the benefits of moving securities to the blockchain. Bancor is often described as the long-tail of value creation, that is, the long tail of low demand and low volume products. In the tokenized security market, one example for this use case is found in the partnership between SPiCE VC, a tokenized VC fund and Bancor. As part of the arrangement, SPiCE VC is committed to holding up to 5% of its capital on the Bancor network, so that token holders can benefit from additional ways to liquidate their holdings.

One of the big promises of the tokenization of assets is to open the floodgates of the global pool of capital, eliminating siloed demand and supply dynamics restricted by geography and infrastructure. Airswap is a decentralized exchange that enables trading on a global scale, connecting individual entities across markets. In the context of security tokens this results in increased liquidity and a generally more stabilized, less volatile demand environment.

### Existing Tokenized Securities:

> _Brave the new world. As there are only a handful of existing issuers and only about a dozen more in the works, this is the frontier of financial innovation._

### [BCap (Blockchain Capital)](http://blockchain.capital/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*4-tTdo1Nlo7q-zMfPbg5bg.jpeg)

Pioneered by Brock Pierce himself, Blockchain Capital was arguably the first to introduce a public offering for a securitized token. In its ICO, Blockchain Capital hoped that it could improve the emerging token sale industry in [multiple ways](https://www.smithandcrown.com/sale/blockchain-capital/). The offering created a blueprint for future tokenized securities, invested in other ICO’s that embodied some of the best practices and accepted funds only from accredited investors. The token sale reached its hard cap of $10M within six hours. The proceeds from the offering were transferred to one of Blockchain Capital’s funds. According to the offering memorandum, the fund’s managing partners collect a 2.5% management fee and a 25% performance fee. The remainder of profits are to be distributed to token holders.

### [Science Blockchain](https://science.tokenhub.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*b3u0eb_q40Ey5lFjR_L6Pg.png)

Science Blockchain is a fund and an incubator focused on blockchain investments. Thus, it’s almost logical that the fund was raised through an Initial Coin Offering of a security token (SCI). The SCI-token provides token holders with rights to up to 70% of the stream of new tokens generated from portfolio companies. Additionally, the fund’s proceeds from liquidity events are anticipated to be used to repurchase tokens via a buyback program, thus allowing investors to enjoy equity appreciation.

**已募集资金：** $12.3M

**管理团队：** Founders Peter Pham, Mike Jones and Greg Gilman, founders and investors in the original [Science incubator](https://www.science-inc.com/).

### [Lottery.com](https://tokensale.lottery.com/)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*YvWcww91m0tyOtvkM1K4mw.png)

Lottery.com, formerly AutoLotto, is a mobile lottery service. The company intends to utilize blockchain technology to enhance its services through instant payouts, transparency, flexibility, and expansion across international markets. The company is nearing the close of the private sale of it’s STO, rumored to be in the nine-figure range. This securitized token produces a financial yield to token holders based on gross raffle sales. Securitize and Cashbet have partnered with Lottery.com to help bring the offering to the market.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*5BqRbOsP2BPzsnppqDv39A.png)

While VCs have been behind almost all the greatest disruptions of our time, the VC industry has remained almost untouched. SPiCE VC intends to change this through its tokenized VC fund model that offers almost immediate liquidity for investors. If, in traditional VC funds, LPs had to wait anywhere between 7–12 years until they gain full access to their funds, SPiCE token holders get a piece of the exit pie, while enjoying a tradable asset. Even though the company intends to invest in some utility tokens, SPiCE is focused first and foremost on security tokens, with Securitize being their first portfolio company.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*wV3U8OpCoptcMBvUFPIyfQ.jpeg)

Startup fundraising is hard. That’s why a group of entrepreneurs from a recent batch of 500 Startups, a highly selective accelerator, came together to form a new tokenized fund. 22X Fund will invest in up to 30 of the startups that graduated from the San Francisco 2017 [500 Startups](https://500.co/) batch. The fund will hold between 2.5%-10% equity in the companies it invests in. Token holders receive their returns by trading the tokens on an exchange or through a token repurchase program that applies after a portfolio company experiences a liquidity event such as an exit or an IPO.

**已募集资金：** $[22M](https://www.22xfund.com/) to date (goal $35M)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Xu-I1MwJVrpf2bNG6Tlnqw.png)

PropertyCoin is another example of how security tokens can transform existing markets. PropertyCoin is opening up real estate, one of the largest asset classes, through a 100% asset backed token. Aperture, the operator behind the STO, intends to invest the proceeds in two business areas — (1) flipping residential properties and (2) lending to other property investors. 50% of the profits will be shared with token holders through reinvestments.

Sia is a blockchain-based, decentralized cloud storage platform on which Renters can lease storage capacity from Hosts. Sia utilizes two tokens, _Siacoin_ and _Siafunds_. Siacoins are used by Renters and Hosts as the currency in which deals are performed on the platform. Renters and Hosts are required to pay network fees to the Sia platform that amount to 3.9% of all spending. Siafunds are entitled to receive a proportional amount of those fees. Nebulous, the operating company of the Sia platform, is offering 750 Siafunds out of a total of 10,000 Siafunds, as a Reg D security token. This is an example of a [‘two-tier’ or dual tokens issuance](https://medium.com/thisisdna/a-world-where-all-tokens-are-securities-227651c4e173), which is used both a security and a utility token.
